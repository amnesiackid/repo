Default branch name has changed

Traditionally git has used the term master to refer to the main or default branch. During years 2020 and 2021 many platforms, such as GitHub and Gitlab, transitioned into using main as the default name for this branch. Git itself followed suit in 2021 and recent versions of git create a branch named main by default.
